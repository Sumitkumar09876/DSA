# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, along with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, arrays, Standard Template Library (STL), strings, binary search, pointers, mathematics for DSA, and analysis of time and space complexity. These implementations are done by Sumit Kumar for my learning.

## Overview

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of computer science and are essential for writing efficient and scalable code. This repository aims to provide implementations of commonly used data structures, algorithms, and related concepts in C++ for educational and reference purposes.

## Data Structures

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence.

### Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top element from the stack.

### Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the rear of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the front element from the queue.

### Binary Tree

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which the value of each node in the left subtree is less than or equal to the node's value, and the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than the node's value.

### Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps can be of two types: max heap, where the parent is greater than or equal to its children, and min heap, where the parent is less than or equal to its children.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

### Graph

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have weighted or unweighted edges.

### Arrays

Arrays are a collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. They provide fast access to elements using an index.

### Strings

Strings are sequences of characters. They are typically implemented as arrays of characters with a null terminator.

### Pointers

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are widely used in C++ for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation of data structures.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. In C++, classes and objects are used to implement OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Standard Template Library (STL)

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of generic data structures and algorithms provided by the C++ standard library. It includes containers like vectors, lists, maps, and algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating these containers.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Graph Algorithms

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.

### Mathematics for DSA

Mathematics for DSA includes concepts like prime numbers, modular arithmetic, number theory, and combinatorics, which are often used in designing and analyzing algorithms.

### Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array.

## Time and Space Complexity

Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms is crucial for analyzing their efficiency and performance. This section discusses techniques for evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms.

## Usage

To use the implementations provided in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumitkumar09876/DSA1.git
```

You can then navigate to the desired directory and compile the source files using a C++ compiler such as g++:

```bash
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
```

Finally, execute the compiled program:

```bash
./program_name
```
