Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, developed by [Your Name].

Overview
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the backbone of computer science and are essential for writing efficient and scalable code. This repository aims to provide implementations of commonly used data structures and algorithms in C++ for educational and reference purposes.

Data Structures
Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of a sequence of elements where each element points to the next element in the sequence.

Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push, which adds an element to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes the top element from the stack.

Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: enqueue, which adds an element to the rear of the queue, and dequeue, which removes the front element from the queue.

Binary Tree
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree in which the value of each node in the left subtree is less than or equal to the node's value, and the value of each node in the right subtree is greater than the node's value.

Heap
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. Heaps can be of two types: max heap, where the parent is greater than or equal to its children, and min heap, where the parent is less than or equal to its children.

Hash Table
A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges. Graphs can be directed or undirected, and they can have weighted or unweighted edges.

Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.

Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

Usage
To use the implementations provided in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-and-algorithms-cpp.git
You can then navigate to the desired directory and compile the source files using a C++ compiler such as g++:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp
Finally, execute the compiled program:

bash
Copy code
./program_name
