/*Question 2 : Password Hacker
Elliot made a KeyLogger for his friend Romero, so that he can see the passwords of his friend. Keylogger is a software that can tell you the buttons pressed in the keyboard without the consent of the user, and hence unethical. Elliot made it to hack Romeroâ€™s passwords. The one problem is, Romero writes the passwords in lowercase characters only, and the keylogger only takes the values of the keys. Like, for a it takes 1, for b 2, and for z 26. For a given number Elliot produces all combinations of passwords in a dictionary and starts a dictionary based password attack. For a given number, print all the possible passwords in a lexicographic order.

Input Format:
One line, denoting the value given by the keylogger

Output Format:
All possible combinations of keyloggers in new lines are lexicographically ordered.

Constraints:
2<=Number of digit in input<=1000

Sample Input:
1234

Sample Output:
abcd
axd
Mcd

Explanation:
For 12, you can take 1,2 that is ab, or you can take l.
